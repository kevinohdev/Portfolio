        <p>Hello, <br/>
          <br/>
          My name is Kevin, and I am a front end developer who has found his true passion in coding 
          after a career in physical therapy. <br/>
          <br/>
          I really enjoy the challenges that comes with web development. My next area of focus include 
          back end web development and mobile applications. <br/>
          <br/>
          My experience as a physical therapist has taught me a lot on effective communication, working through
          tough situations and managing time efficiently.  As a front end developer, I hope to continue to improve these skills
          while contributing to exciting projects. <br/> 
          <br/>
